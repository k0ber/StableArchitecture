# Stable Architecture

The goal of this project is to show main architecture approaches in Android developing. 
Unlike [googlesamples/android-architecture], here we have provided examples with survivable business logic. It means, after view recreating, its state remains the same. 
And the important requirement for this examples is as simple and as understandable as possible.

####Repository state:
  - mvvm-factory - survivable, can be improved
  - mvvm-dagger2 - survivable, can be improved
  - mvp-factory - survivable, satisfactory
  - mvp-dagger2 - not survivable yet
